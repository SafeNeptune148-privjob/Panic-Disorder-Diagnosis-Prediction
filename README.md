# Panic-Disorder-Diagnosis-Prediction
This project uses real-world data and several ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression, Clustering) to predict whether an individual is likely to suffer from Panic Disorder, a psychological condition thatâ€™s often hard to diagnose early.

 Motivation
Diagnosing panic disorders is difficult, but early detection can save lives. This project aims to support medical professionals through data-driven prediction and insights.

 Dataset
Sourced from [Kaggle](#), containing 100,000+ instances with medical, demographic, and psychological features.

 Models Used
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Logistic Regression
- Hierarchical Clustering (Gower + T-SNE)

 Key Results
- XGBoost Accuracy: **0.99**, 0 False Negatives
- Insightful clusters found using Gower distance
